# Neural-evolution-agent-BLACKJACK
A Neural network Agent optimized by Evolutionary algorithms to play BlackJack or 21 (using just python/numpy/pandas)  

## NEURAL EVOLUTION FROM SCRATCH (numpy and pandas)

This is a __neural network agent__ evolved by __genetic algorithm__ using only python and numpy library to play blackjack.  

This implementation is slow and take some time to converge for good results.  

 I used a minimalist version of blackjack (A game known as 21 or vinte-um in Brazil). 
 
 The neural network use as inputs itself score, the player with higher score less than 21 and the cummulative sum of all cards played until that particular turn.  

## See the jupyter notebook file to implementation and results
